%% Text of abstract
Fluid injection into the earth has a wide range of applications such as hydraulic fracture and sequestration of carbon dioxide. 
However, 
due to the prevalent existence of geological faults, 
fluid injection can potentially cause dynamic fault slip (earthquakes), 
which can be destructive. 
Therefore, 
it is crucial to understand what effects different injection strategies (injection rate as a function of time) may have on the stability of fault slip, 
and how we can avoid large destructive earthquakes by controlling the injection. 
Besides, 
a series of recent studies have shown that the surrounding bulk material around such geological faults have significant effects on the stability of fault slip. 
Typically the bulk material is modeled as linear elastic, 
while recently researchers have also developed poroelastic modeling of the bulk to better capture the fluid transport as well as its coupling with solid deformation. 
However, 
the different effects on fault slip between elastic and poroelastic bulk remains to be further explored. 

In this study, 
we apply and further develop a boundary integral code that simulates fault slip with rate-and-state friction and poroelastic surrounding bulk, 
to study the effects of fault healing, 
poroelasticity and injection rates on the stability of fault slip under fluid injection. 
We first find that fault healing reflected by the initial slip rate significantly affects the occurrences of dynamic slip events under injection, 
which is consistent of previous studies. 
We further develop the code to allow for simulations with purely elastic bulk and the same fluid transport formulation. 
We find that poroelasticity stabilizes fault slip under injection, 
and that under typical injection time scales, 
poroelastic bulk behaves similarly to elastic bulk with undrained Poisson's ratio. 
Finally, 
we find that faster injection rates generally lead to more frequent, earlier occurrences of dynamic events, 
but the events are more spatially constrained. 
This motivates injection strategies like intermittent injection rate, 
to achieve more spatially constrained, 
less destructive earthquakes.
